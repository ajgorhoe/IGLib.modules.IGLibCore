This repository contains basic portions of the restructured ***Investigative Generic Library*** (***IGLib***). **IGLib** is currently undergoing some changes.

The original repository for this container is located at

> *https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.modules.IGLibCore*

The legacy IGLib's base library is located at:

> *https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib.git*

However, IGLib consists of many other libraries and demo applications. Check the readme of the above library for more information.
