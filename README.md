## IGLib Restructuring

[Legacy IGLib libraries](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib/blob/master/README.md) contain lots of useful tools from different areas. Not all of these libraries were made publicly available, as many were developed within corporate environment. Due to complex dependency structure, some of these libraries were not ported to the new open source .NET (Core) when it was introduced by Microsoft in 2014. Some libraries could be ported to .NET but were slowly abandoned becaue the new .NET exosystem changed significantly and some of the crucial dependencies were not actively developed or supported any more.

### Legacy *IGLib* Libraries

Bulding legacy IGLib libraries is a bit more tricky due to their complex tependencies. See the [IGLib repo's readme](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib/blob/master/README.md) file to learn more about this.
