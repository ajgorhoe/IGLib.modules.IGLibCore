# TestBaseExamples Project

This project contains some **example tests**. You can look up the project to see how to do certain things in test projects. In particular, *[ExampleTestClass.cs](./ExampleTestClass.cs)* shows how to create tests with parameters, either with cased where input data that can be specified with constant expressions, or cases where this is not possible.
