# Nongeneric Type Conversion

This contains both regular usility classes and test classes for non-generic (isngle type) conversions, such as conversions to int type.

For base types (such as those implementing the IConvertible interface - string, int types, floating point types, date types, etc.), single type conversion utilities such as ToInt() were obsoleteConvertToType(...) and ConvertToType<TargetType>(...).

These types are therefore archived in the test project, togetherr with the corresponding tests, for the purpose of looking up the implementation and just in case, if implementing such utilities would still prove useful at some point.
