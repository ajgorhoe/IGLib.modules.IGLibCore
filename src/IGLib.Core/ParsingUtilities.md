# Generic Parsing Utilities

This project contains generic parsing utilities to parse strings into various simple types such as numeric integer (`int`, `long`, `uint`, etc.) and floating point types (`float`, `double`, `decimal`), `char`, date and time types (`DateAndTime`, `DateAndTimeOffset`, `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`).

These utilities are used to convert user input to supported type, especially console input but also input obtained fom text files or graphical user interfaces.
